Returns error. Abstract classes cannot be constructed directly.

\description{
Abstract class for the representation of the 'special' mathematical sets.
}
\details{
Special sets refer to the most commonly used (and important) sets in mathematics. Including
the sets of natural numbers, integers and reals.

This is an abstract class that cannot be constructed, instead construct one of the implemented
SpecialSet child-classes. For a full list of these see \code{\link{listSpecialSets}}.
